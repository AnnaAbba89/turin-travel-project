            <h2>Why Turin</h2>
            <h3>Turin, the city at the foot of the mountains</h3>
            <p>
              Turin is a city and an important business and cultural centre in
              Northern Italy. It is the capital city of Piedmont and of the
              Metropolitan City of Turin, and was the first Italian capital from
              1861 to 1865. The city is mainly on the western bank of the Po
              River, below its Susa Valley, and is surrounded by the western
              Alpine arch and Superga hill.
            </p>
            <p>
              As of 2018, the city has been ranked by GaWC as a Gamma-level
              global city. Turin is also home to much of the Italian automotive
              industry, hosting the headquarters of Fiat, Lancia, and Alfa
              Romeo. The city has a rich culture and history, and it is known
              for its numerous art galleries, restaurants, churches, palaces,
              opera houses, piazzas, parks, gardens, theatres, libraries,
              museums and other venues. Turin is well known for its Baroque,
              Rococo, Neoclassical, and Art Nouveau architecture.
